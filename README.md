# vanish
Hide files under Windows folders using Alternate Data Streams (ADS).
This project contains two files: hide.py and unhide.py
The former is for making all files under a folder vanish into thin air, given the path to the folder.
The latter will make the same files visible again, given the same path to the folder with hidden files.
